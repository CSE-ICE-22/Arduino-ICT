# Arduino Door Alarm

Contains the code and setup instructions for an Arduino-based Door Alarm system that triggers a piezo buzzer when a door is opened, using a reed switch as the sensor.
>**LinkðŸ”—**: [Tinkercad Simulation]()

## Required Components

To build this project, you will need the following components:

- **1 Ã— Arduino Uno**: Microcontroller-based development board to control the door alarm system.
- **1 Ã— Piezo Buzzer**: Generates an audible alarm when the door is opened.
- **1 Ã— Reed Switch**: Detects whether the door is open or closed.
- **1 Ã— 10kâ„¦ Resistor**: Pulls down the voltage and limits current flow to the ground line for the reed switch circuit.

> **Simulation Note**: Since Tinkercad does not provide a reed switch, a pushbutton is used to simulate the reed switch for testing purposes.

## Hardware Setup

1. **Reed Switch (or Pushbutton for Simulation)**:
   - Connect one leg of the reed switch (or pushbutton) to Arduino pin 9.
   - Connect the other leg to Arduino GND via a 10kâ„¦ resistor (acting as a pull-down resistor).
   - Optionally, connect the same leg to Arduino 5V to ensure a HIGH state when the switch is closed (for pushbutton simulation, Tinkercadâ€™s pushbutton may include internal pull-up/pull-down).
2. **Piezo Buzzer**:
   - Connect the positive pin of the piezo buzzer to Arduino pin 8.
   - Connect the negative pin to Arduino GND.
3. **Assemble**:
   - Use a breadboard for prototyping or solder for a permanent setup.
   - For a real-world setup, mount the reed switch on the door frame and a magnet on the door such that the switch closes when the door is closed and opens when the door is opened.
   - Verify connections to prevent short circuits.

> **Tip**: Ensure the reed switch is aligned with the magnet for reliable detection. In Tinkercad, simulate the door opening by pressing/releasing the pushbutton.

> **Warning**: Double-check buzzer polarity and switch connections to avoid circuit issues.

## Arduino Code

```cpp
const int BUZZER_PIN = 8;
const int SWITCH_PIN = 9;

void setup() {
  pinMode(BUZZER_PIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(SWITCH_PIN, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  int switchState = digitalRead(SWITCH_PIN);
  if (switchState == LOW) {
    tone(BUZZER_PIN, 262);
  } else {
    noTone(BUZZER_PIN);
  }
}
```

> **Info**:
> - The `setup()` function initializes pin 8 as an output for the buzzer and pin 9 as an input for the reed switch (or pushbutton).
> - The `loop()` function reads the state of the switch on pin 9.
> - If the switch state is LOW (door open, or pushbutton pressed in Tinkercad), the buzzer generates a 262 Hz tone (middle C).
> - If the switch state is HIGH (door closed, or pushbutton not pressed in Tinkercad), the buzzer stops.
> - The 10kâ„¦ pull-up resistor ensures a stable HIGH state when the switch is open.

## How to Use

1. Upload the code to the Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect the hardware as described in the setup.
3. For Tinkercad simulation, use a pushbutton to mimic the reed switch:
   - Pressing the button simulates a closed door (HIGH, no alarm).
   - Releasing the button simulates an open door (LOW, alarm sounds).
4. In a real setup, install the reed switch and magnet on the door and frame.
5. Power the Arduino via USB or an external power source.
6. The buzzer will sound when the door is opened and stop when the door is closed.

> **Success**: If the buzzer sounds when the door is opened (or pushbutton released in Tinkercad) and stops when closed (or pressed), the setup is correct. If not, verify wiring, switch alignment, or code logic.

> **Debugging Tip**: If the buzzer does not behave as expected, check the switch state by adding `Serial.println(switchState)` to the loop and monitoring via the Serial Monitor (add `Serial.begin(115200)` to `setup()`). Ensure the (pull-up or pull-down) resistor is correctly connected.
